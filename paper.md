# Summary

At large research facilities and industrial complexes, there is a need of control system user interfaces. However, modern facilities also require continuous upgrading, maintenance, and development, which means that also the control systems need to be upgraded. In order to simplify the construction of control systems and diagnostics, I created the DynaGUI (Dynamic Graphical User Interface) package. The main idea of this package is to get rid of the middle-hand coding needed between hardware and the user by supplying the user with a simple GUI toolkit for generating diagnostics- and control-system GUI:s in accordance with any userâ€™s need.

In order to further enhance the user-friendliness of this package, I have designed a simple system for configuration files, described in the first section. In the four following sections, the system requirements is defined followed by the sections for the three DynaGUI package tools (DynaGUI TF (true/false controllers), DynAlarmsGUI (a diagnostics system to continuously monitor a set of attributes such that their values do not go above or below a user-specified limit) and DynaGUI NV (a system for observing attributes' values and a set of realtime plotting methods)).

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$
